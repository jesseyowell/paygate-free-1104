title: Add live tables from a virtual connection
excerpt: >-
  Add tables from an established virtual connection. For increased security,
  endpoints that interact with external connection sources require an Enterprise
  Admin Token. This token can be found under [Advanced
  Settings](https://data.world/settings/advanced). To learn more about the
  virtual connections data.world supports, please visit our [help
  portal](https://help.data.world/hc/en-us/sections/360009504254-Create-and-manage-virtual-connections).
