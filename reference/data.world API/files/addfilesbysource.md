title: Add files from URLs
excerpt: >-
  Add files from URLs to a dataset. This method allows files published on the
  web to be added to a data.world dataset via their URL. This method can also be
  used to retrieve data via web APIs, with advanced options for http method,
  request payload and authentication.


  The source URL will be stored so you can easily update your file anytime it
  changes via the *fetch latest* link on the [data.world](https://data.world/)
  dataset page or by triggering the `GET:/sync` endpoint.  
api:
  file: data-world.json
