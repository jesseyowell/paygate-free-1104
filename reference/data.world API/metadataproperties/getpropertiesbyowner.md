  Get supported metadata properties by owner.


  This endpoint can be used to obtain a reference list of supported custom
  metadata properties for your organization's catalog. Custom properties for
  resources in your catalog require an ApiBinding to be configured for use in
  the public API. For more information about how to correctly configure
  ApiBindings, please reach out to your data.world support representative or
  message help@data.world.
